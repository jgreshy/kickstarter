# Kickstarter Campaigns Portfolio Project

## [View Queries Here](https://github.com/jgreshy/kickstarter/blob/main/queries)

## Project Overview:
-- The goal behind this analysis is to find the general trends behind successful campaigns and unsuccessful kickstarter campaigns. I only used completed Kickstarter campaigns, designated as either 'successful' or 'failed', in this analysis. This was done to rule out the effects of ongoing campaigns on the analysis.
-- Alternatively, Kickstarter can use this analysis to allocate money towards marketing channels that will bring in more backers and entrepreneurs in categories that have a track record of success. Using Excel, a random sample was taken out of the dataset of 300,000 records to be queried.

Focused On:
- Nested queries
- Ranking/Sorting
- Use of Time/Date Operations
- Statistical Analysis
